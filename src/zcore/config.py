"""ZCore Core Configuration Module.

This module provides the core settings and configuration loading infrastructure for the
ZCore framework. It leverages Pydantic Settings (v2) for validation and environment 
variable parsing, and registers itself within the dependency injection (DI) container
to support singleton management. A dynamic proxy is also provided to support lazy resolution
across the application lifecycle.
